# pa_1

Programming Assignment 1 for CS4261

Backend: Python Flask
Front-End: React Native with Expo


Server: Flask

The following are the steps to run the server. This should be run before the app
is run.

    1. Open a console, and cd to the directory pa_1

    2. In the same console, cd into `./services/server/`.

    3. Ensure that python is installed on your system and type in, depending on your python installation

            `pip install -r requirements.txt`
                        or
            `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


    4. Allow all modules to download, and simply type in either

                `python3 ./services/server/main.py`
                        or
                `python ./services/server/main.py`

        This will boot the server and make it accessible to the localhost (http://localhost:5000) (This should be by default)



Front-End: React Web App

The following instructions highlight how to run the expo app.

    1. Open a new console, and cd into the directory, `pa_1/services/web`

    2. In the console, enter the command `yarn install` (you will need yarn installed on your computer).

    3. Give the app a couple of minutes to load, and it should pop up in the localhost:3000 position.

    4. Get ready to play!
